**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
The most voted apps are the most popular social networks, games and music apps.

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
The top rated apps are mostly games that are not among the most popular ones (or most voted).

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
We can observe that the most popular apps (the most voted ones) are not the top rated ones, probably due to a much higher diversity in the voters and therefore in their opinions.

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**
I have obtained a table ordered by rating and then by number of votes, obtaining the following top 3:
Head Soccer
Plants vs. Zombies
Sniper 3D Assassin

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
People care about the price in the sense that the most voted (and therefore most popular) apps and are the free ones. However, the most expensive ones, even if they have low user volumes, receive higher ratings than the free ones.

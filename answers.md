Top 10 most rated apps are free. The genres range from games to music to social networking/photo video, as Instagram can count as Social Networking too.


8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

Almost all of the genres for the top rated apps are games. Some of them are not free but do not exceed 2$.

It's already done in the apps best rated.


11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

Free apps:
Num apps	Average size		Average_rat_count	Average_user_rating	STD_user_rating
4056		147935700.2101		19749.8047		3.3767258382642997	1.6446046897612976

Payment apps:
Num apps	Average size		Average_rat_count	Average_user_rating	STD_user_rating
3141		265247839.5820		4038.5371		3.720948742438714	1.3112621143830145

I compared the number of apps, the average size,rating count and user ratings for free apps and payment apps:
There are more free apps than payment apps. 
The average size for payment apps almost doubles the avg size for free apps.
The free apps have an average of ratings almost five times greater than the ratings for payment apps.
The user ratings average is slightly better for payment apps than for free apps (3.72 to 3.37) and the results arre less spread for payment apps, meaning that quality of payment apps is valued by that customers.
Free apps can be good too, but they can also be worse.

Looking at the top 10 most rated apps it is observed that social networks are probably the most downloaded apps, followed by games and streaming music apps.

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**

It is observed that looking for the top apps in terms of user rating is not enough to clearly distinguish a trend. This happends because there are too many apps with the highest user rating. Thus, it is nice to provide a complementary analysis in the following question.

With the previous insight we can make a rough estimation that people consume about 10 times more *Free than Paid* Apps, based on the average number of ratings obtained per genre. In addition, we will get a comparison between free and paid Apps based in the average user rating obtained. For the free Apps, the Top 5 based on average user rating per genre is the following:

USE applestore;
SELECT * FROM data;

11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

USE applestore;
SELECT * FROM data;
SELECT 
    track_name, price, rating_count_tot, user_rating
FROM
    data
ORDER BY price DESC , user_rating DESC;

People do not care much about the price, since some of the best rated apps are not free. 
Also the amount of ratings is not dependant on the price, because we can see a lot of variance between values.

Mostly social networks and games.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
Most of them are paid, none of the is a social network. Probably, thse apps don't need to deal with crossing lots of data fom users, like social networks like facebook and instagram do.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
All of the top 10 most rated apps are free. There is no social network among the top 10 best rated.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?
Filtering by rating = 5 and using number of votes to order:
Head Soccer
Plants vs. Zombies
Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game

11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

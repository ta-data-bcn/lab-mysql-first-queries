# Q1
use applestore;
select distinct(prime_genre) from data

# Q2
use applestore;
select prime_genre, rating_count_tot from data
group by prime_genre
order by rating_count_tot DESC

The genre is social networking.

# Q3
use applestore;
select prime_genre, count(id) from data
group by (prime_genre)
order by count(id) DESC

The genre with more apps is games, the count can be done with any column since we just want the number of rows
grouped by genre.

#Q4
use applestore;
select prime_genre, count(id) from data
group by (prime_genre)
order by count(id) 
 
The genre with less is catalogs.

#Q5
use applestore;
select rating_count_tot, track_name from data
order by rating_count_tot DESC
limit 10

#Q6
use applestore;
select user_rating, track_name from data
order by user_rating DESC
limit 10

#Q7
 We see social media apps, games and music being the most rated, which would make sense given that are the most used by users and belong
to the categories with the most apps available. The bible seems to be an outlier.

#Q8
The best rated top ten is mainly populated by games (which again given the incredible competition in this genre, 
some few awesome results are expected) and then we have utilities, education and photography which could also be considered a utility. 
Maybe this are simple apps that perfectly match the function they were designed for.

#Q9 
Comparing the 2 tables we see that the most rated apps are nowhere to be seen amongst the best rated, and the other way around.
there seems to be a negative correlation between how extended an app is and how well it is rated. However we see that spcially thee
games and music ones have quite a good rating even though they are not in the top ten (4.5).

#Q10
use applestore;
SELECT track_name, rating_count_tot, user_rating from data
order by rating_count_tot DESC, user_rating DESC
limit 3

#Q11

This will give us the most expensive, most rated apps, which we can use as a proxy for most downloaded:
use applestore;
select user_rating, track_name, prime_genre, rating_count_tot, price from data
order by rating_count_tot DESC, price DESC

Even though  we sorted for most expensive the top ones are still free and actually the most downloaded one (Facebook)
has a rating lower than those in its level of volume of review (3.5)
If we take the DESC out to see the bottom values we see the apps that have the less amount of ratings are also free. 
We could say, the price does not affect how much people are going to rate (download) an app.

If we just order by price like this:
use applestore;
select user_rating, track_name, prime_genre, rating_count_tot, price from data
order by price
from the cheapest on, we see that there are very heterogeneous apps in terms of amount and point of the ratings.

if we do:
use applestore;
select user_rating, track_name, prime_genre, rating_count_tot, price from data
order by price Desc
we'll get them sorted from the most expensive on, which gives us interesting insights: 
top 3 most expensive apps are for productivity and except the first one which has only 71 reviews 
( which is normal at a price point of 99.99), the rest have quite large review numbers  (mostly on the thousands).

So an app being free is certainly not enough for people to download it, the price does affect however the rating, typically the apps 
with a respectable pool of rewievs, that have a price of around 10 euros (which is the maximum not counting the outlier) have 4.5 ratings.
The number of reviews for same-price apps is heterogeneous as well. 

use applestore;
select user_rating, prime_genre, rating_count_tot, price from data
group by prime_genre
order by price desc

this gives us the genres by price and generaly looking at review numbers it seems people are more prone to pay for games, video/photo and utilities
although these tend to have different price points, with utilities being the most expensive.

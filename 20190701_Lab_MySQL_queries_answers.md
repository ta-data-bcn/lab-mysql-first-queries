    The mean rate between the 10 apps most rated. The mean will be around 1500000. 


8. Take the mean rate between the 10 apps best rated. Don't calculate the mean, just see the data!
    They have the same mean: 5. 


9. What do you see here?
    I see that there's much more variability between the mean on the 10 apps most rated and the mean of the 10 best rated with the current value, 
    The distribution is more concentrated around 5 in the second case rather than in the first one. 

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?
    Head Soccer
    Plants vs. Zombies 
    Sniped 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game. 

11. Does people care about the price?
    Yes, at the beginning since when the app costs 0 a lot of people download the app, and there's a huge difference between the downloads of those apps. 
    However, when the price increases, there are not such huge difference and there are for example more downloads for apps with a price os 13.99 than 
    apps of 11.99. And also the rating can vary significantly. this means that not only the price has influuence on the number of downloads, but 
    also the app itself and its quality.

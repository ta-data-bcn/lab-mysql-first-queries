-- 7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.
-- All the applications are free. Also, those applications are mostly divided in three main groups: Games, Social Networking and Music.

-- 8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
-- All the applications are paid (except for Flashlight). Also, major part of the applications are from Games, but there you can find new genres not find on the question below, like Business or Education.

-- 9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
-- The Games genre can be found both on the top free applications and the paid ones. 

-- 10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

/* 
What I wanted to check is the average amount of ratings per App, checking the difference between the free and the paid ones.
Although the difference of apps per price doesn't create a big gap - There are +4K free apps and +3.1K paid apps -, the amount of ratings it does.
The total ratings of the free apps surpass the 80M and the paid ones the 12M.
If we check the avg amount of ratings per price, we see that a free app might have almost 20K ratings, meanwhile a paid app will barely surpass the 4K.
Mention that, of course, the difference is bigger as the price increases, but the cheapest paid app (0.99â‚¬) has 7.1K ratings, almost three times less than a free app.
